# Protofilio

A clean, animated portfolio built with Next.js 14 and Framer Motion. Sections highlight featured work, experience, and contact actions with a modern glass aesthetic.

## Getting started

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site uses the app router (`/app`) and TypeScript. Update copy, links, and project data in `app/page.tsx` and `data/projects.ts` to make it yours.
